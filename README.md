### REQUIREMENTS

It doesn't have to be perfect. Font sizes, colors, etc, don't have to be the exactly the same. We give more value to those who **DON'T** any library to produce the result. Anything can be done using only with HTML and Sass. All images are provided in `src/assets/images/` folder.

### FINISH

When you finish you should run `gulp build` to generate all files into the `build/` folder.

### OUTPUT

The output should be a responsive version of these next images.

#### Phone

## Tech

The source files (editable) are located in the `src/` folder.
To ensure the integrity of the project you should only edit these files inside this folder.
The gulp scripts are able to handle with preprocessing (html, sass, etc...)
