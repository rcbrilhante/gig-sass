# Sass gig

## Project: How to run (first steps)

`npm install` --> install local dependencies from **package.json**

`npm install gulp` --> install local gulp dependency

### Develop mode (in terminal/cmd run)

`gulp` --> (runs the project in dev mode, starts a local server and opens the window on the local server endpoint)

---

### INPUT

It doesn't have to be perfect. Font sizes, colors, etc, don't have to be the exactly the same. We give more value to those who **DON'T** any library to produce the result. Anything can be done using only with HTML and Sass. All images are provided in `src/assets/images/` folder.

### OUTPUT

The output should be a responsive version on these next images.

---

#### Desktop

![desktop](src/desktop.jpg "Desktop")

---

#### Phone

![phone](src/phone.jpg "Phone")

---

## Tech

The source files (editable) are located in the `src/` folder.
To ensure the integrity of the project you should only edit these files inside this folder.
The gulp scripts are able to handle with preprocessing (html, sass, etc...)
